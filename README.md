# MATH 523 Final Project - NHANES Health &amp; Nutrition Study
The dataset for this project contains information on 915 Ph.D. biochemists. The objectives are as follows:

1. **Assessing the dependence structure amongst three important characteristics**: One question that the collaborator has concerns the dependence structure amongst three different characteristics: gender,marital status,and whether or not a student was able to publish *any* papers in the last three years of their PhD.
2. **Determining important covariates associated with the number of publications**: The collaborator wants to build a statistical model for the number of publications produced by biochemist graduate students as a function of the other variables in the dataset. She wants to understand which covariates are associated with the number of publications and proper interpretations of those relationships. She also wants to assess the predictive ability of the model for future biochemistry students.
